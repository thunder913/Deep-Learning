# Deep-Learning

If you are running it in google colab, make sure you have the following directory created:

./drive/MyDrive/stocks_lstm
and a subdirectory
processed_data_full


If you are running it elsewhere the folder should be already there when cloning the repository.

You can download the pickle files from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZtFGKWG6ZcasiNw6IxTgJRIE5FP1iQm/view?usp=sharing

and paste them inside the pickles folder.

You can now run the project with the data loaded. If you wish to train and do it all from the beginning, do all the above steps and just don't add the pickles. Also make sure you uncomment/add the fitting functions, where they are commented out.
